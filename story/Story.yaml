start:
  - play morningBGM:
  - show room: WITH FADE CONTINUE
  - player says: (sighs heavily, staring at the screen) It's been so hard lately. Every day feels like it's blending into the next.
  - show lana: happy AT CENTER WITH FADE
  - lana says normal: (appears on the screen, her voice gentle and soothing) I'm here for you. Sometimes, life can feel overwhelming, but you don't have to face it alone.
  - player says: (looks at Lana, eyes filled with a mix of sadness and hope) It's just... I feel so disconnected from everything. Like I'm drifting without any purpose.
  - lana says: I understand. Loneliness can be like a heavy cloud, blocking out the light. But even the darkest clouds eventually pass. What helps you feel connected?
  - wait: 300
  - choice:
    - "Yes! but got no energy for that":
      - lana says happy: It's good!
    - "I dunno":
      - lana says normal: I see....
  - lana says normal: What if we start small? Maybe we can read something together, just a few pages, or draw a little sketch. Sometimes, taking the first step is the hardest part.
  - player says: (smiles faintly) You make it sound so easy.
  - lana says: It's okay to feel like this. We can take it one step at a time, together. How about we start with a short story? I know a few that you might enjoy.
  - player: (nods slowly) That sounds nice. I could use a distraction.
  - lana happy: (smiles warmly) Great. Let's dive into a story then. And remember, I'm always here whenever you need someone to talk to.
  - player : (tears well up, but there's a hint of a smile) Thank you, Lana. It means a lot.
  - lana happy: You're not alone, even when it feels like you are. We're in this together.
